This means that, unlike with other leading blockchains today, they are no longer forced to exist as smart contracts on someone else's chain. They can opt-out of high transaction fees and network congestion, make their own rules, and scale for mainstream adoption. This has massive implications for the future of decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), gaming, autonomous organizations, social networks, marketplaces, and the sustainable growth of blockchain technology, the internet of value, and the ownership economy in which everyone has a stake.

The WFTM rewards will be collected and distributed daily to the beFTM Earnings Pool where users can stake beFTM to earn WFTM. The beFTM Vault deposits the beFTM in the Earnings Pool and uses the share of the vault to buyback beFTM with the WFTM rewards. By doing so, the beFTM vault adds a continuous buying pressure to the beFTM token price. \n\nbeFTM can be: \nDeposited in the beFTM Vault for compounded interest in the form of more beFTM. \nDeposited in the WFTM Earnings Pool for simple interest with WFTM rewards. \nStaked in beFTM-FTM liquidity pools on all the major DEXes on Fantom. \n\nThere are several mechanisms in place to help beFTM maintain peg against FTM. First of all, Beefy's Smart Minter will not issue new beFTM tokens when the price of beFTM is below the price of FTM, it will instead buy beFTM from a liquidity pool helping to restore the peg and giving the user a more profitable option. Secondly, the beFTM vault adds a continuous buying pressure to the beFTM token price. Lastly, arbitrageurs will either buy and sell beFTM depending on the peg. \n\nIn a hypothetical situation where the peg crashes to 0 with no signs of recovery, Beefy's Validator Node can be paused, forfeiting all pending rewards, and after waiting 1 full week everyone will be able to redeem their beFTM for the delegated FTM.",

COMP tokens are mainly used for protocol governance. COMP holders can suggest, debate, and implement changes to Compound - without relying on, or requiring, the Compound team whatsoever. COMP also allows its owner to delegate voting rights to an address of their choice. \n\nCompound is a decentralized blockchain protocol that allows users to lend or borrow selected cryptocurrencies. It establishes money markets by pooling assets together and algorithmically setting interest rates based on supply and demand of assets. To supply or lend crypto assets on Compound, users will have to deposit their crypto assets into the Compound protocol and it will be aggregated into a liquidity pool. Once users have made the deposit, they will receive cTokens in return. Users will start accruing interest by holding the cTokens. \n\nOnce assets are supplied to Compound, users are allowed to use the assets as collateral. Based on the collateral factor of the assets deposited, users can start borrowing from Compound. Because Compound uses an overcollateralization model, you can never borrow more than what is collateralized. ",

The cap of Cowswap tokens is fixed. The team will reserve 50% of the transaction fee to the project treasury, and regularly repurchase part of the tokens at market prices for destruction; this keeps Cowswap tokens deflationary to increase the value of the tokens. \n\nCoW Protocol is a fully permissionless trading protocol that leverages Batch Auctions as its price finding mechanism. CoW protocol enables batch auctions to maximize liquidity via Coincidence of Wants (CoWs) in addition to tapping all available on-chain liquidity whenever needed. Batch Auctions are continuously run by the protocol because the solvers, the parties in charge of finding the most optimal settlement for the batch, are in competition to settle it. The winning solver will be the one that can maximize traders surplus by either having the most optimal CoW, finding the best liquidity sources, or combining both in a single settlement. \n\nCoincidence of Wants (CoWs) are one of the most, if not the most, innovative aspects of the protocol, but what exactly are they? CoWs are settlements which share liquidity across all orders who have matching limit prices. Rather than an AMM or an CLOB, CoW protocol uses batch auctions as a core mechanism to facilitate CoWs. Using batch auctions leads to better prices for the individual traders as well as offering big savings, in terms of gas fees optimization and liquidity provider fees. Additionally, because of Batch Auction uniform clearing prices and CoWs not needing access to on-chain liquidity, CoW protocol is able to offer the user a level of MEV protection that can not be achieved by any other protocol.",

  "token.all.crv.desc": "CRV is the governance token for Curve Finance. Curve is a decentralized exchange liquidity pool on Ethereum designed for extremely efficient stablecoin trading. It implemented a complex time-based staking system to exchange CRV into veCRV, where veCRV is an internal token intended for governance purpose and has a right to claim the cash flows generated by the protocol. \n\n1 CRV locked for 4 years = 1veCRV \n\n1 CRV locked for 3 years = 0.75veCRV \n\n1 CRV locked for 2 years = 0.50veCRV \n\n1 CRV locked for 1 year = 0.25veCRV \n\nCurve Finance conducted one of the biggest retroactive token airdrops on 14 August 2020 to reward early users, with a vesting period up to 4 years. It intends to have yield farming for all of its pool, with the reward weightage voted by the veCRV holders. \n\nYield Farming refers to the activity of depositing and locking capital in a DeFi Protocol for the reward of the protocol's native tokens. DeFi protocols need to bootstrap capital to provide liquidity for exchanges, lend to borrowers, underwrite insurance risk, etc. It acts as an incentive to attract users to use the protocol while generating hype, giving out part of its native tokens. \n\nYield farmers will have to constantly monitor their veCRV power to get the maximum payout from the yield farming exercise as veCRV decays with time. There is a calculator built that shows this in detail. For further information do refer to the official documentation. \n\nSimilar to Uniswap, Curve Finance is an Automated Market Maker (AMM) based Decentralised Exchange (DEX). Unlike Uniswap, its main focus is only to swap between assets that are supposed to have the same value. This is useful in the DeFi ecosystem as there are plenty of wrapped tokens and synthetic tokens that aim to mimic the price of the real underlying asset. \n\nFor example, one of the biggest pools is 3CRV, which is a stablecoin pool consisting of DAI, USDT, and USDC. Their ratio in the pool will be based on the supply and demand of the market. Depositing a coin with a lesser ratio will yield the user a higher percentage of the pool. As such when the ratio is heavily tilted to one of the coins, it may serve as a good chance to arbitrage. \n\nCurve Finance also supports yield-bearing tokens. For example, it collaborated with Yearn Finance to release yUSD pools that consisted of yDAI, yUSDT, yUSDC and yTUSD. Users that participated in this pool will not only have yield from the underlying yield-bearing tokens, but also the swap fees generated by the Curve pool. Including the yield farming rewards in terms of CRV tokens, liquidity providers of the pool actually have three sources of yield. ",

It was founded by the Maker Foundation in 2015 as an open-source project to offer economic freedom and opportunities to anyone, anywhere. In 2017, it launched  the Maker governance token (MKR) and its first stablecoin iteration known as the Single Collateral Dai (SAI), which used Ether (ETH) as collateral. \n\nTwo years later in 2019, the Foundation released the Multi-Collateral Dai (DAI), phasing out SAI. The platform has enjoyed widespread adoption and is the largest decentralized lending platform with around $2.58 billion in total value locked (TVL), as of December 2020. \n\nWhat can Dai (DAI) do? Dai has several strong benefits and use cases. Most notably, Dai's soft peg to the US Dollar helps mitigate price volatility. In the cryptocurrency space where price swings are common and dramatic, this feature helps preserve Dai's value and promotes its use as a medium of exchange. \n\nAdditionally, the stablecoin's decentralized nature means that it is highly composable with other decentralized applications (Dapps) such as Compound, Uniswap etc. It also provides greater transparency and censorship resistance compared to centralized solutions. \n\nThe source code for the protocol can be viewed freely by anyone who wishes to do so.

A modified fork of Bitcoin, it is considered both the first meme coin, and, more specifically, the first dog. Despite its satirical nature, some consider it a legitimate investment prospect. Dogecoin features the face of the Shiba Inu dog from the Doge meme as its logo and namesake. It was introduced on December 6, 2013, and quickly developed its own online community, reaching a market capitalization of over $85 billion on May 5, 2021. \n\nDogecoin started with a supply limit of 100 billion coins, which would have been far more coins than the top digital currencies were then allowing. By mid-2015 the 100 billionth Dogecoin had been mined with an additional 5 billion coins put into circulation every year thereafter. Although there is no theoretical supply limit, at this rate, the number of Dogecoins put into circulation will only double in 20 years (the next doubling will occur in the year 2075). There is no implemented hard cap on the total supply of Dogecoins. Nonetheless, in February 2014, Dogecoin founder Jackson Palmer announced that the limit would be removed in an effort to create a consistent reduction of its inflation rate over time. In other words, the inflation rate improves over time starting at 5% in 2015 to less than 4% by 2019, 3% by 2027, and 2% by 2035. \n\nElon Musk frequently uses his Twitter platform to express his views on Dogecoin, which has led some to claim that his actions amount to market manipulation because the price of Dogecoin frequently experiences price movements shortly after Dogecoin-related tweets released by Elon Musk. Nevertheless, because cryptocurrencies are not regulated like stocks, these actions are not illegal. Musk and his promotion of Dogecoin have been criticized by Dogecoin co-founder Jackson Palmer, who called Musk a 'self-absorbed grifter'. \n\nMusk's first Dogecoin-related tweet occurred on December 20, 2020. Musk tweeted 'One Word: Doge'. Shortly after, the value of Dogecoin rose by 20%. This was followed by a series of Dogecoin-related tweets by Musk in early February 2021 captioned 'Dogecoin is the people's crypto' and 'no highs, no lows, only Doge'.

  "token.all.fxs.desc": "FXS or The Frax Share token is the non-stable, utility token in the Frax protocol. It is meant to be volatile and hold rights to governance and all utility of the system. \n\nIt is important to note that Frax Finance takes a highly governance-minimized approach to designing trustless money in the same ethos as Bitcoin. Frax eschews DAO-like active management such as MakerDAO. The less parameters for a community to be able to actively manage, the less there is to disagree on. \n\nParameters that are up for governance through FXS include adding/adjusting collateral pools, adjusting various fees (like minting or redeeming), and refreshing the rate of the collateral ratio. No other actions such as active management of collateral or addition of human-modifiable parameters are possible other than a hardfork that would require voluntarily moving to a new implementation entirely. \n\nThe FXS token has the potential of upside utility and downside utility of the system, where the delta changes in value are always stabilized away from the FRAX token itself. FXS supply is initially set to 100 million tokens at genesis, but the amount in circulation will likely be deflationary as FRAX is minted at higher algorithmic ratios. The design of the protocol is such that FXS would be largely deflationary in supply as long as FRAX demand grows. \n\nThe FXS token's market capitalization should be calculated as the future expected net value creation from seigniorage of FRAX tokens in perpetuity, the cash flow from minting and redemption fees, and utilization of unused collateral. Additionally, as the market cap of FXS increases, so does the system's ability to keep FRAX stable. \n\nThus, the priority in the design is to accrue maximal value to the FXS token while maintaining FRAX as a stable currency. As Robert Sam's described in the original Seigniorage Shares whitepaper: “Share tokens are like the asset side of a central bank's balance sheet. The market capitalisation of shares at any point in time fixes the upper limit on how much the coin supply can be reduced.” Likewise, the Frax protocol takes inspiration from Sams' proposal as Frax is a hybrid (fractional) seigniorage shares model. \n\nAs of May 2020, the protocol now allows FXS holders to lock up FXS tokens to generate veFXS and earn special boosts, special governance rights, and AMO profits.

OHM aspires to become an algorithmic reserve currency backed by other decentralized assets. \n\nSimilar to the idea of the gold standard, OHM provides free floating value its users can always fall back on, simply because of the fractional treasury reserves OHM draws its intrinsic value from. Each OHM is backed by 1 DAI, not pegged to it. Because the treasury backs every OHM with at least 1 DAI, the protocol would buy back and burn OHM when it trades below 1 DAI. This has the effect of pushing OHM price back up to 1 DAI. OHM could always trade above 1 DAI because there is no upper limit imposed by the protocol. Think pegged == 1, while backed >= 1. You might say that the OHM floor price or intrinsic value is 1 DAI, but in reality, the actual price will always be 1 DAI + premium with the premium being decided by the market. \n\nAt a high level, OlympusDAO consists of its protocol managed treasury, protocol owned liquidity (POL), bond mechanism, and staking rewards that are designed to control supply expansion. Bond sales generate profit for the protocol, and the treasury uses the profit to mint OHM and distribute them to stakers. With liquidity bonds, the protocol is able to accumulate its own liquidity. As the protocol earns revenue, the token price rebases so that every OHM holder will always own the same overall percentage of the protocol. \n\nIn the long term, OHM hopes to acquire enough assets into its treasury to provide a solid backing for a completely decentralized store of value and medium of exchange not unlike Bitcoin.",

This may be due to price inefficiencies and/or volatility in the various markets that Hera.Finance routes through. \n\nTrade Splitting - Hera dex aggregator will split your trade into smaller trade sizes.  For example, if you want to make a 100 USDC-METIS trade, it may distribute your trade into a 30 USDC-METIS trade on Netswap and a 70 USDC-METIS trade on Tethys Finance.  The % distribution of the trades is dynamically determined to give you the best price. Trade splitting helps get better prices for large size trades and  trades with tokens where there is shallow liquidity spread out across a number of DEXes.",

This improves on WBTC and imBTC by removing the need to trust a centralised custodian. \n\nRenVM is powered by thousands of independently operated machines, known as Darknodes, which require bonds of 100K REN tokens to run.

This secret ECDSA private key cannot be revealed and cannot be used to sign transactions, without cooperation of 1/3rd+ of the Darknodes. This enables each shard to securely lock assets into its custody. \n\nWith these assets secured, the protocol is then able to issue tokens such as renBTC onto smart contract networks.",

This means that whenever synths are issued, SNX tokens are locked up in a smart contract. Synthetix is a decentralized synthetic asset issuance protocol founded by Kain Warwick and the Synthetix Foundation. Initially, it was known as Havven when it first launched in September 2017. During its seed round and token sale, it managed to raise $30 million by selling 60 million HAV tokens to investors. In late 2018, the platform expanded its vision and rebranded to Synthetix. Today, the platform is the largest decentralized exchange for derivatives in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, boasting an impressive ~$700M in total value locked (TVL) as of November 2020. \n\nSynthetic assets or Synths are derivatives that provide exposure to real world assets on the Ethereum blockchain. Similar to derivatives in traditional financial markets, Synths allow users to hedge and reduce their risk, speculate on price movements and gain access to unavailable assets or markets. This is all accomplished without an individual ever holding the underlying asset. \n\nSynthetix Network Token (SNX) is primarily used as collateral to mint synthetic assets. SNX holders can head over to Mintr to stake their SNX into the Synthetix smart contract and create sUSD - synthetic United States dollars. The amount of sUSD minted will depend on two factors: i) the amount of SNX staked, and ii) the collateralization ratio (C-Ratio) of the platform. At present, the C-Ratio is 600%. This means that in order to mint 1 sUSD, a user would need to stake at least 6 SNX as collateral. \n\nSNX is also used to earn rewards. SNX holders who stake their SNX into the platform are incentivized to do so through two main reward mechanisms: i) exchange rewards and ii) staking rewards. Exchange rewards are generated whenever a trade takes place on Synthetix, the value of which can range from 0.1-1% of the trade value, though it is typically 0.3%. Staking rewards meanwhile, are rewards from the protocol's inflationary monetary supply. The new SNX generated by the protocol is given to SNX holders who stake their tokens. Both these rewards are distributed as SNX on a weekly, pro-rata basis and are escrowed for 1 year.  This is subject however, to an individual's compliance with the target C-Ratio.",

  "token.all.stg.desc": "STG is the native utility and governance token of Stargate and can be used for staking, liquidity provision, and participating in protocol governance. Token holders can stake their STG to receive Stargate’s voting escrow token, veSTG. The protocol uses a time-weighted reward system that boosts the amount of veSTG that stakers receive the longer they keep it locked. This design keeps circulating supply pressure down and also helps align users that are interested in the long-term success of the protocol. \n\nStargate is a fully composable cross-chain bridge protocol built on LayerZero that enables native asset transfers between different blockchain networks. A major shortcoming of most current bridges is that they are unable to send native assets from one chain to another. Instead, they rely on the use of a wrapped or “intermediate” token to complete the bridging process. The problem with this approach is that it is extremely inefficient and makes the user experience onerous. Stargate is designed specifically to remove the need for wrapped tokens and lets users send native tokens directly to non-native chains. The protocol is built around unified liquidity pools shared between chains that ensure instant guaranteed finality. Stargate’s goal is to make cross-chain bridging a seamless and single transaction process. \n\nWith traditional web3 bridges, developers face three signification issues: They must make a compromise between native asset transaction requirements, instant guaranteed finality, and unified liquidity. Most bridge designs favor sacrificing the use of native assets and instead utilize a wrapped token to replace the native token. The end result is typically a Lock-and-Mint or Burn-and-Redeem mechanism. In general, the way these approaches work is by requiring the user to deposit the native asset of their source chain into the bridge’s smart contract, at which time the bridge then mints a wrapped version of the asset (e.g. $ETH → $WETH) on the destination chain. This achieves instant guaranteed finality since assets are minted 1:1 on the destination chain. It also removes the risk of reversion due to lack of liquidity. Yet a critical issue with this method is that once a wrapped token is minted on the destination chain, the user must then manually convert it into a native asset on the destination chain. Otherwise, they cannot use it; it merely serves as a vessel to complete the bridge. \n\nAnother issue is around liquidity and scaling. Bridges can only function properly if both the source chain and the destination chain have sufficient liquidity. So each time a new blockchain is integrated into a bridge protocol, the bridge must also bootstrap liquidity between each existing blockchain currently integrated. This places significant limitations on a bridge infrastructure’s ability to quickly scale and adopt new networks. \n\nTo solve the Bridging Trilemma, Stargate has developed a novel cross-chain bridge mechanism, ∆Bridge, and balancing algorithm, the Delta (∆) algorithm. Paired together, they enable cross-chain liquidity and purely native token transfers. ∆Bridges let users send native assets directly and seamlessly between different blockchains, without the need for an intermediate token and without any deprecation of interoperability or composability. ∆Bridges are powered by a unified liquidity pool shared amongst chains to ensure that each side of the bridge has sufficient liquidity, prevent transaction reversion, and achieve instantly guaranteed finality. Stargate’s ∆algorithm can be thought of as the backbone here as it supports ∆Bridges by automatically rebalancing liquidity pools. This design lets the ∆Bridge framework integrate numerous blockchain networks and scale more quickly and efficiently than most alternative. \n\nAll of this is in part achievable because of LayerZero’s infrastructure, which is an omnichain communication protocol that provides robust inter-chain communication between large blockchain networks. This foundation enables Stargate to effectively communicate bidirectionally between source and destination chains, and ultimately makes it possible to bridge native assets while preserving instant guaranteed finality and unified liquidity.",

Key decisions such as usage of the treasury or future upgrades can be decided through a governance vote. \n\nUniswap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that makes it easy for users to swap an ERC-20 token for another ERC-20 token without the need of a centralized intermediary. With a DEX, traders do not have to deposit their tokens on an exchange and be exposed to the security risks of a centralized exchange. \n\nUsers just need an Ethereum wallet like Metamask and they can immediately start swapping tokens. Users can then swap tokens directly without the need of an orderbook. This works using an Automated Market Maker (AMM) where Liquidity Providers (LP) deposit tokens into the smart contract and this liquidity then provides a price quote to traders without relying on any professional market makers. Liquidity Providers are compensated with a 0.3% trading fee for providing liquidity on the protocol. \n\nAn AMM uses a pricing algorithm to price assets. Uniswap uses the “x*y = k” formula to price its assets. Within the formula, x represents the amount of one token in the liquidity pool, y is the amount of the other asset and k is a fixed constant. In Uniswap, the value of both assets constantly remains at a ratio of 50:50. Uniswap popularized the AMM model and other crypto protocols started utilizing the AMM due to its innovative and decentralized features. However, one of the biggest setbacks for the AMM model is impermanent loss. Impermanent loss is the opportunity cost of contributing two crypto assets into a liquidity pool instead of holding the two crypto assets separately outside the liquidity pool. Impermanent loss occurs when the price of one token rises or falls relative to the other. The larger the change, the larger the impermanent loss will be.",

YFI initiated the first community-fair-launched token distribution, giving out 30,000 tokens to early protocol's users by a surprise yield farming announcement back in 17-July-2020. \n\nThe protocol is maintained by various independent developers and is governed by YFI holders. \n\nIt started out as a passion project by Andre Cronje to automate the process of switching capital between lending platforms in search of the best yield offered, as the lending yield is a floating rate rather than fixed rate. Funds are shifted between dYdX, AAVE, and Compound automatically as interest rates change between these protocols. \n\nThe service offered includes major USD tokens such as DAI, USDT, USDC, and TUSD. For example, if a user deposits DAI into yearn.finance, the user will receive yDAI token in return, which is a yield-bearing DAI token. \n\nLater on, it collaborated with Curve Finance to release a yield-bearing USD tokens pool that includes four y-tokens: yDAI, yUSDT, yUSDC and yTUSD, it is named as yUSD. \n\nYearn Finance debuted the vault feature after its token launch, igniting a frenzy on automated yield farming and is considered the initiator of the category of yield farming aggregator. Basically, the vault will help users to claim yield farming rewards and sell it for the underlying assets. \n\nVaults benefit users by socializing gas costs, automating the yield generation and rebalancing process, and automatically shifting capital as opportunities arise. End users also do not need to have proficient knowledge of the underlying protocols involved or DeFi, thus the Vaults represent a passive-investing strategy. It is akin to a crypto hedge fund where the aim is to increase the amount of assets that users deposited. \n\nYearn Finance was launched in July 2020 and its governance token, YFI was released to the community through a fair launch. At its initial release, because there were no fundraising nor valuation placed on Yearn Finance, the market did not fully comprehend the value capture and not able to figure out the market value for it. \n\nAs Yearn Finance continued to attract liquidity by allowing people to easily earn and participate in DeFi, YFI token went from $30 to $43,000 within 2 months from its launch. \n\nIn 2021, Yearn Finance continues to solidify its position as the gold standard for yield aggregator in which it managed to hit an all-time high of $91,000 on May 12th, 2021 alongside with the peak of the cryptocurrency markets. Yield Farming refers to the activity of depositing and locking capital in a DeFi Protocol for the reward of the protocol's native tokens. DeFi protocols need to bootstrap capital to provide liquidity for exchanges, lend to borrowers, underwrite insurance risk, etc. It acts as an incentive to attract users to use the protocol while generating hype, giving out part of its native tokens. \n\nOther than simple yield farming, Yearn Finance also released a product named delegated vault. Delegated vaults basically use any assets as collateral to borrow stablecoins and recycle the stablecoins into a stablecoin vault. Any subsequent earnings are then used to buy back the asset. \n\nFor example, one of the delegated vaults is yETH, where users can deposit ETH and expect to have more ETH when they withdraw. The ETH is sent to Maker DAO as collateral in order to draw DAI where the DAI will be invested into the DAI vault, with subsequent earnings used to buy back ETH. Andre became one of the most famous DeFi thought leaders as he launched Yearn Finance single-handedly, witnessing YFI price went up by roughly 55x in less than 3 months, valuing Yearn Finance by more than $1 billion. He is vocal on Twitter with his ethos of fair token launch and having a bias on launching experimental projects before audits, which gave birth to one of the DeFi main activities “Aping”. \n\nAping basically means buying the tokens the moment it launches in Ethereum mainnet before fully knowing the function of the tokens. It normally involves directly interacting with the Ethereum contract before a website UI is out or buying it straight from DEX such as Uniswap. It is a high risk activity, causing many investors to lose their fund to scams. But the lure of getting early access to tokens that might go up rapidly in price is attracting tons of speculators. \n\nOne of the examples is when Andre launched EMN, a game economy engine called “Eminence” that was subsequently hacked for $15 million. Subsequent launch of the KP3R token, a network that facilitates keepers to perform automated tasks on behalf of requestors, saw the price go up by 22x in less than 3 months, valuing KP3R at more than $100 million. The activity of aping will not die down anytime soon with numerous projects achieving high valuation within a short span of time.  \n\nDuring the weeks of 24 November until 3 December 2020, Yearn Finance announced the Merger and Acquisition (M&A) of multiple protocols, essentially forming an alliance revolving around YFI. \n\nSushiSwap joined as its Automated Market Maker (AMM) arm. \n\nCover joined as its insurance arm. \n\nCream joined as its lending arm. \n\nAkropolis joined as its institutional service provider for yVaults and upcoming lending products. \n\nPickle joined as one of its strategists. \n\nThere are even multiple Yearn Ecosystem Index tokens launched such as YETI by Powerpool and YPIE by PieDAO.",

  "token.all.xdai.desc": "xDAI is the native token of the Gnosis Chain. xDai tokens are used to pay for gas and transactions on the xDai chain. They are a stable token (worth ~ 1 USD) created from locked Dai. \n\nxDai is a cryptocurrency created from the MakerDAO DAI token. Dai is a stable token on the Ethereum mainnet pegged to the US dollar. xDai can be acquired by users in a number of ways (for example with a credit card) but behind the scenes it is always created from Dai, and the value of xDai corresponds 1:1 with Dai. \n\nA stable coin means peace of mind. Predictable currencies allow buyers and sellers to exchange value without the risks of volatility. In the Gnosis Chain implementation, transactions are conducted using xDai, a stable coin with 1:1 value ratio to Dai. Because transactions occur on a bridged chain, they are extremely fast and inexpensive. In addition, transactions and fees are paid with a single coin. \n\nGnosis Chain supports low cost, stable transactions for projects and users. The chain provides a compatible chain for projects requiring nano-transactions or complex transactions that may be prohibitively expensive on Ethereum.  Gnosis can scale both vertically (infrastructure and chain parameter optimization) and horizontally (additional chain deployments) to meet capacity requirements.",
